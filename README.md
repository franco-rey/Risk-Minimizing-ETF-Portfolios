The purpose of this project is to compare the results of time period length on the asset allocation determined using mean-variance, Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) allocation procedures.

We obtain the adjusted closing prices for seven ETF tickers from 1 January 2005 to 1 April 2024 covering various market segments, and compute the continuously compounded rates of return.

The goal is to output the optimal portfolio allocations that minimize variance, MAD, and CvaR, and observe how they change with target return rates of 2%, 4%, 6%, and 8%.
